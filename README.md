Lifelong fan, changed my life, taught me to feel again yada yada you know the deal. we stan. 

Just gotta say that Nurture is absolutely wonderful. I was apprehensive but it's totally blown me away, went in an incredibly wholesome and relatable direction. The pitched vocals are sublime, absolutely love em. 

I'm sure others have better more insightful questions but...

I gotta know **what jacket/windbreaker did you wear during Secret Sky II?** 

Absolute fire, literally watching the set again as I read through this thread. Must be my 8th watch by now.

And I guess, top tips on overcoming imposter syndrome? I guess the album tells that story, but seeing as you're a veteran of dealing with imposter syndrome would love your tips and techniques for dealing with it. 

Oh, and one more while i'm here - how did it feel having the Shelter video premiere in Shibuya? Absolutely next level, to have your own AMV created by one of the leading animation studios. That's some bucket-list topping achievement right there.

Big love from the UK!

🤫🤫

> And I guess, top tips on overcoming imposter syndrome? I guess the album tells that story, but seeing as you're a veteran of dealing with imposter syndrome would love your tips and techniques for dealing with it.

there's two things i'd say here:

**1) everyone feels their own work has a bit of a 'stank' on it lol**

my younger brother mark used this phrase while looking at his own design once: "you know everything you make kinda has that 'stank' on it?". i've carried that with me a lot. it's just something you can't get away from. you can never hear your own music for the first time. same goes for any creative field

**2) you're comparing your insides to everyone else's outsides**

comparison is a dangerous game anyway, but it's also almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy or real perspective.

i talk about instagram this way a lot: in your feed, you see other people's photos after they've posed with the intention of being photographed, with selected lighting, they've taken 400 photos and chosen the most flattering one, and then adjusted colors and often times used beauty apps. and there's another degree of "filtration" there -- sometimes people take all of those steps and then don't post a photo.

it's a highlight reel of a highlight reel of a highlight reel of a highlight reel.

and then you compare that to your own face when it accidentally pops up in the forward-facing camera.  lol 

making music is like that. artists tend to show the best 5% of their work. that's why it's better to have compassion for yourself as you're being creative rather than judging the thing you're doing. that's your insides YA GOTTA LOVE IT

i just feel extreme gratitude that the music is helpful. Thank u so fucking much

> **Also, what are your go-to techniques to get inspired/pull yourself out of a creative slump?**

there's really no one size fits all technique which is something that makes creativity so hard (and so beautiful when you can capture it).

but one thing I find really helpful is to explore a technique that you're basically bad at and know nothing about.

i find that if I revert to the techniques I know how to do well (begin with a chord progression, write a hook melody, sing nonsense autotune until i start to hear words) I'm more likely to get stuck and judgmental of what I'm doing. 

whereas if i try a technique i know NOTHING about, like a synth i'm unfamiliar with or sampling a style of music I don't particularly like -- well, it's hard to get judgmental about the result. You're just messing around. 

the less judgmental you're feeling, and the more playful and explorative you're feeling, i find the likelier it is to have a creative and fun process. but it's scary to try a technique you don't know about, especially if you fear failure. but you just gotta do it BITCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

 Hi Porter! Congrats on Nurture! It's absolutely stunning. I have a couple questions.

1. Do you imagine yourself returning to Virtual Self? Playing shows, releasing more music ^^^^^maybe ^^^^^God ^^^^^Rays ? 

2. Is Second Sky 2021 going to be like 2019 where both days are the same lineup or is it a 2-day lineup?

3. Speaking of second Sky, were there intentional hints to Nurture in your Second Sky ‘19 set? I feel like there were small hints of Get Your Wish and Something Comforting in Fresh Static Snow.

4. I can't find any contact info or agent, so I'm hoping you might be in contact with him. What do the fans have to do to get DJ Potaro to play a club set somewhere? Did he restock on body wash?

5. On the creativity front, what would be your number 1 tip for breaking out of writer's block? I so often have a really hard time finishing the last 10% of writing music and lyrics and often abandon projects entirely and wonder if you have similar struggles.

Thanks for doing this! I can't wait for Second Sky this year.

**/u/porter_robinson:**

> Do you imagine yourself returning to Virtual Self? Playing shows, releasing more music maybe God Rays ?

if I return to virtual self, i think it'll need some kind of new inspiration or a fresh angle on it.  i'd really love to -- i'll follow the muse and perhaps it'll lead me back there.



I've mentioned before that this 3 hour and 45 minute VS set was the most fun I ever had performing. I really really miss DJing as virtual self for sure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8PAyv8826c




> Speaking of second Sky, were there intentional hints to Nurture in your Second Sky ‘19 set? I feel like there were small hints of Get Your Wish and Something Comforting in Fresh Static Snow.



The only thing I can really think of is that I used that Nurture "vocal pad" sound at the end of the set. i remember worrying that it was slight spoilers

Wait actually I just listened and maybe that was just a supersaw. I'm fucking tripping (am I thinking about the end of Secret Sky 1?)

 Hey Porter, what was the production process like for your Virtual Self EP? How did you know it was *just right* for this vibe you were trying to capture?

Aside from rhythm games, where else did you find a lot of your music that inspired the project, as well as music that you played at your shows? 

Thank you!

**/u/porter_robinson:**

good q!

Part of getting VS right was having some familiarity with the history and techniques of that era I was trying to replicate (1999-2003). For one, I tried to use Sidechain sparingly, since that's a fairly "modern edm" feeling effect. I tried to make sure that my supersaws were mono and the delay was the thing that gave them the stereo effect, because most trance supersaws at the time were made by the JP-8000 / JP-8080, and that's a mono supersaw (the unison detune isn't panned out into the stereo field).

I also just am super obsessed with eras of electronic music, so like... I REALLY feel like I know a 2010 kickdrum (HUGE vengeance-y transient) vs a 2014 kickdrum  (clicky, long decay) vs a 1999 kickdrum (prominent pitchdown effect, transient comes from the sine) etc etc etc. I did a lot of collecting 'historical' samplepacks and stuff like that too. so a lot of it comes down to picking the right samples

**/u/SkumbagMatte:**

 Hello Porter!

&#x200B;

I would like to take this occasion to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the music you make. Sea of Voices has been my favorite track since its release, and now Unfold has taken that spot. I find the choruses of these tracks are quite similar.

&#x200B;

I already excuse myself in case this might be too much to ask, could you please share some insight on how these choruses are made? You said you had a rule of not using any synths in nurture -- which is why i'm asking. As a fellow musician, you inspire me a lot and I would love to get some insight in the productive process.

&#x200B;

Have a wonderful rest of the day, and thank you again for Nurture!

**/u/porter_robinson:**

I think something like "Sea of Voices" or "Unfold" has a TON to do with the chord voicings, moreso than the sounds!

also just fyi, (so you don't accidentally box yourself in!) -- I didn't really have a "no synths" rule, but I did try to preferentially use sampley or recorded soundsources.

Unfold definitely has a worlds-style synth stack in the chorus!

 Hey Porter. First just wanted to say, we love you! My partner and I are moving out to Colorado. We just left chapel hill, NC today. We always hope we can see you, but alas! 

Secondly, how have you dealt with the idea of people wanting a “Worlds II” when creating this new album? Did you ever feel pressure to give in? (I’m really glad you didn’t btw<3)

**/u/porter_robinson:**

> Secondly, how have you dealt with the idea of people wanting a “Worlds II” when creating this new album? Did you ever feel pressure to give in? (I’m really glad you didn’t btw<3)

this is so fucking kind lol.

I didn't feel that kind of pressure - when I'm working, I actually get excited in my own head about reinventing myself, it's one of the things that drives me!

but it still affects me when people demand I make the music they want for them. there's a couple things i wanna say about this, actually

1) the reason you see me bugging out and tweeting shit like this https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/925412057431904256?lang=en is because i was DEFINITELY afraid of rejection, and feeling like my new work was being misunderstood scared me and pissed me off. I definitely find this aspect of it a little uncool and shameful but it's true so I'm sharing it.  

2) 

I think people who demand an artist "go back" to an older style are confused about what made the work good. the reason "Worlds" was good was because I was sincerely passionate and excited about expressing that exact set of ideas at that time. i was at an age where that was what was on my heart. The sincerity made it good. 

I think anything I tried would end up sounding like a parody or pale imitation. the passion and sincerity glued it together, not the style!

also, like... when people demand that I go back to Worlds, I just want to show them the same tweets/posts/comments from 2014 demanding I go back to making music like  like Spitfire. and then I want to show the Spitfire people the crowd who was upset that and demanding I go back to making Ekowraith music 

The thing is, there's just a natural culling that occurs when artists follow their passions. You will lose some people. But I think if you fail to follow the ideas that get you truly excited, you'll lose everyone.

2. Are there any songs that almost didn’t make it onto the final project?

> **Are there any songs that almost didn’t make it onto the final project?**

Sweet Time. i was doubting that one but the people in my life were like PORTER YOU ARE FUCKING CRAZY, KEEP IT. but now I don't know why I was doubting it - i  reallly really love that song. Especially the last minute and a half

 Hello, Porter! Congrats on your comeback after 6 years, for Nurture, for Secret Sky and a breathtaking performance of yours. It's such a blessing this album came after such a tumultuous journey you had to create it. Here are some questions I had from the album and overall from your creative process today:  


1) How do you manage writer's block these days? Do you still feel like the best songs you've ever written come quickly or do you prefer taking your time until you figure out the song?  
2) Did you record your album at your home studio or did you go to other studios to record it? I've seen that in multiple interviews you've talked about finishing LATS in Japan and recording your album alongside Madeon's Good Faith.  
3) How much did the art direction for Nurture evolve from its early days until now? Would we be able to see some of the concept arts SBJ and you made for the album?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

> 1)Do you still feel like the best songs you've ever written come quickly or do you prefer taking your time until you figure out the song?

it's weird -- Blossom was written in 1 night, and I think that's one of the best song I've ever written. But I also love Something Comforting and that took like 5 years. I don't think there's that much of a connection between the final quality and time spent.

omfg I'm so happy for you. CONGRATULATIONS on being a survivor. I'm so sorry you faced cancer. 

a family member going though cancer is an absolute whirlwind of confusion and suffering and hope and anxiety. it actually can't be described. I love Mark so much and I'm so glad he's okay. It's actually processable when you think about the sheer volume of people going through that exact kind of fear and suffering at this very moment. I felt like the Robinson Malawi fund was one was the reduce suffering in the world.

"Mother" was definitely written with Mark on my mind a lot. I don't want to disclose too many details on Mark's behalf, but my mom was an actual saint during his treatment.

2. What do you find to be the most fun part of making music?

> I remember reading somewhere that while you were working on Worlds that you kept a folder where you'd save any image you'd find that fit the aesthetic/mood you were trying to achieve with that album. How did you go about developing the core aesthetics for Virtual Self and Nurture?

Virtual Self began with a few images that I knew would be the core of the inspiration -- mostly stuff derived from Bemani games, forum sigs, fanmade Stepmania charts, a few game box arts (PSO2 was definitely central).

For "Nurture", a lot of it came from a certain feeling I had in my heart, and I'd take photos in reality that captured that feeling. The Nurture "mood board" was 90% my photos (but some of those photos were of things like CD covers I saw in stores, or anime box art, or travel posters I saw in Japan, etc). It's weird, but somehow filtering it through my own experience made the images more meaningful for me. 


> What do you find to be the most fun part of making music?

1) That first 10% of working on an idea where it's all exploration and untapped potential. So fucking exciting
2) Programming the video show and rehearing a new liveshow. God I love working on editing visuals so much.  With writing the music, i do so much on my own, so it's extremely fun to get together with a team of people - my LD, VJs, visuals designers, etc -- and realize the vision as a group. 

When we're putting together the live show visuals, that's something I work on just as hard as the music, but it's much more collaborative.

 HIIIII PORTERRRR!!! Fhwmfbeilsjrksmdbeksmb

From every music release since Worlds you have seemed to put music out in such a purposeful way with a large scale project to back each release. You had the Worlds and Nurture albums, an entire alias for Virtual Self, and a tour and music video dedicated to Shelter. Can you provide some insight as to why you prefer to have your music be supported by these larger, immersive ideas? And do you ever think you’ll ever move away from this format?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

when I make music, I'm trying to like... "bathe" in it. I really want to be immersed as fully as possible into the worldview of what I'm working on.

Like with Virtual Self, that vibe existed in my head, but I wasn't going to be satisfied until i could GO there!

When I love something, I just want to get closer and closer and closer to it. The way for me to scratch that itch is to somehow embody it. That's why I try to make the liveshows so all-encompassing and singular. Like, it's my way of making the feeling "real" and bridging the gap between the idea and reality.

I had been dreaming about being at the front of the stage with a microphone in my hands for a few years at that point, but it was harder than I imagined -- it was like this perfect place where I had something I wanted to do, and it was the right level of challenging for me. I want to get even better in this "frontman" role I'm so fucking excited

 Hey Porter! Long time fan here and just wanted to let you know Nurture means the world to me. But I do have a question, I saw your story about how you went to japan and stayed at masakatsu takagi’s place (legendary) with the intentions of working on music. Even though he didn’t directly contribute to wind tempos aside from the toy piano sample, i feel like i can directly hear the influence in there and wow is that song just breathtaking. With that said, given his multiple works with hosoda, could you ever see yourself contributing to a film score?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

i've written literally hundreds of small, self-contained and unfinished piano works over the last two or so years. (the piano solo in Wind Tempos is one of those). I would really love for those to have a home

 Hey porter! I had a question about Nurture!

I noticed a lot of things that *could* connect to the Nier series of games, and the amount of them leads me to believe it's too much to be a coincidence. I was just wondering if you did that intentionally, such as with Virtual Self and Serial Experiments Lain, or if it was one of those situations where inspiration just bleeds through into your work unintentionally.

Planning on going to Second sky so I'll see you there! Thanks for doing this!

The things I noticed were

 -one of the vocal effects in Wind Tempos seems to be the same as the machines in Nier: Automata

-Look at the sky is the name of a prominent document in the first Nier game

-"Shoulder the weight of the world" the lyric in Unfold is the same as the final/theme track for Nier: Automata where the title and chorus also contain the phrase "weight of the world"

**/u/porter_robinson:**

i'm so sorry, the only experience I have with Nier is playing as 2B in the most recent Soul Calibur game. that map REALLY made me want to check it out, though -- the overgrown aesthetic of that world really really resonates with me

**/u/tripleschezwanrice:**

 how do you pronounce dullscythe and how did you make it?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

just as "dull scythe".

the technique was really straightforward, actually -- i took one of my piano iphone recordings and chopped it up off the grid. So that rhythm was kind of designed to sound accidental, but it was carefully programmed.

the initial idea was for dullscythe to be an interlude that only consisted of that choppy sample.

then I started layering additional sounds, and once i layered that first kickdrum, i was like HOOOO BOY. this idea of a song that REALLY tightly and powerfully follows a semi-nonsensical rhythm got me super super excited

 what compelled you to use so many more real instruments this time around? i'm a violinist who got into producing electronic music a few years back and nurture's been really inspiring for me lately, so was just curious if you were listening to anyone in particular that inspired you! 

(also, is the melodica on Lifelike and Trying To Feel Alive real? or a synth? i can't tell but i love it)

**/u/porter_robinson:**

> (also, is the melodica on Lifelike and Trying To Feel Alive real? or a synth? i can't tell but i love it)

it's real! using and recording the melodica was a late addition to the album, but I wish i did it from the beginning. Such a pure sound

 hey porter!

first of all, i love nurture so much - been a while since an album hit me this good.

i was so (positively) surprised, that you played us a full stage production of nurture live last weekend! that evening meant the world to me, it just fully filled me with a happiness i havent felt for a while, but it got me thinking:

where did the change of mind come from, considering that you previously were very against ever releasing your live edits?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

I guess I'm thinking about Nurture a lot differently. i'm barely thinking of these versions as "Live Edits" -- something like the Fresh Static Snow live edit is so radically different that it almost felt like a dubplate or something, so I wanted to protect that.

The edits for Nurture -- I wanted them to feel faithful to the songs and barely-edited. The places where there are TRUE switch-ups came from me being unable to stop myself lol (the jungle drop on Sad Machine and the trap drop of do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do.)

The trap drop on do-re-mi might be my favorite moment of the show, that bass feels SO good in person, I can't wait to play that out

**/u/osa_ka:**

 hey Porter! we've met a couple times after your shows in Boston and here's to hoping the world allows it again!

how do you go about writing lyrics? I've just started playing with the idea of singing on my own music (artist name is Souma) but I find coming up with lyrics that fit the timing of a song really difficult, especially without them sounding super cheesy.

**/u/porter_robinson:**

don't worry about this -- writing lyrics is INSANELY FUCKING HARD and still is for me now. So try not to judge what you're making too much.

I don't think I wrote a single good lyric for the first like 2 years of working on Nurture. It was very very far and few between.

The cringe / cheesiness is normal. Just remember you're an absolute beginner at it, so give yourself some compassion and room to grow. Keep practicing. If you ever hear a turn of phrase in media, or literature, or in a conversation, or in your own internal monologue and it resonates with you, write that down.  You'll get it eventually

 hi porter! i was introduced through your music by your secret sky set. at the time i was not an avid listener of electronic music- and when you played ‘get your wish’ i asked myself “why is  this dj playing an indie pop song?” 


with the success of look at the sky on alternative radio- how do you feel about your music being reached by audiences other than those in the electronic scene?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

this is a really interesting question.

around the time of my last album, "Worlds", i was really consumed with "not being edm".

nowadays, i realize that definitely came from a point of insecurity. i was way too worried about how i was being percieved. there's amazing edm, amazing non-edm electronic music, amazing folk music, amazing metal, amazing ambient music. there's great music in all styles.

i'm really just happy if anyone wants to listen to my music.

 Hey Porter! Big fan of your work ever since I heard Sad Machine.  


I kinda of wanted to ask about dullscythe from Nurture. The song is structured in a way where it really feels like it wants to become something but doesn't know how to for the first half of it, after which it just kind of stumbles into that "sound" and finds its footing.  


I'm pretty dang sure this song is about your struggle in that period of depression you had where you tried and couldn't make anything that sounded good to you.  


My question is about some parts in the song (like for example 1:34), where I get a lot of Virtual Self vibes for some reason from different sounds that I hear when I listen to it.  


Is this intentional? Like, is it supposed to represent that period of time where you kind of jumped into and created the Virtual Self project? It might be just me overthinking it but I'd love to get a confirmation (or disconfirmation) on that haha  


Love you lots!! <3  【=◈︿◈=】

**/u/max_melgarejo:**

 hey porter!! been loving the album so much these past few days. it really made my last weekend so so so special. thank you so much!

i was listening and loving how catchy some of the lyrics are, specifically do-re-mi... gets stuck in my head and makes me happy! is there any lyrics you were particular satisfied with when they came together? or your favorite delivery of those lyrics from yourself? any lyrics that were particularly hard to get just right?

**/u/porter_robinson:**

the very hardest vocal on the whole album to 'get right' was Trying to Feel Alive.

that was the very last song written for the album, and because i was kind of stuck on it, i became very worried that i hadn't progressed at all, that I hadn't actually improved, and that the premise of the album would then be a lie. (You can see the sheer distortion of the OCD / Anxious thinking there, but that's where I was).

of course, the reality is much more complicated: i had, of course, improved in so so so many fucking ways in relation to my own creativity, life balance, overall level of happiness, level of productivity, mindfulness, ability to sing, ability to write lyrics. but in that 'fight or flight' state, all of that was invisible to me.

the big error there was the perfectionism. demanding that, in order for me to consider myself 'better', that i can never fail or get stuck. that's obviously not right.

it's helpful for me to think of recovery as an "upwards spiral"! you won't ever be perfect, but it's okay as long as you're broadly moving in the right direction.

so anyway, back to the lyrics: i really wanted to write something for Trying to Feel Alive that felt truthful but also helpful. Something that expressed how I was still kind of scared, but that didn't contradict the central meaning of the album. And that took weeks.

I remember this breakthrough, when I thought: "Wait -- do I actually want to be *happy* happy? Like, completely satisfied, now that the album is done? Do I actually want to be DONE?" and the answer was a resounding fuck no. I realized that it's actually a precious gift to be dissatisfied, because that keeps you moving forward. I always want there to be another mountain to climb -- I feel purposeful when moving forward, even if I know no destination will ever truly satisfy.

So the final lyrics of the album: 

"Well, do you feel better now?


I thought I'd run until the sky came out


But with the sunlight on my face


Something changed



And just trying to feel alive


You climbed a mountain, are you satisfied?


As you stand at the top


You already wanna do this


One more time



Maybe it's the a that I couldn't recognize


Maybe I don't really need to feel satisfied


Maybe it's a gift that I spent all this time


Just trying to feel alive



Maybe I don't really want to be satisfied


Maybe it's the gift that I couldn't recognize


Maybe this all -


Maybe this was all- ...



Then somebody somewhere finds


The warmth of summer in the songs you write


**Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize:**


**Trying to feel alive"**
